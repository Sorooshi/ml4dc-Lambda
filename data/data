Dear All,

First of all, I would like to thank you for your participation.

Secondly, I would like to inform you that in the following link, you can find:

1) A PDF version of my Ph.D. thesis
2) A PDF version of my presentation
3) A recorded video in .MP4 format, which I have recorded for my today's talk so that if any issues arise with my internet connection or computer, one can play the video. Once I come back, I can continue the talk.

Link to the material:
